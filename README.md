# SIMuR
## Source Indexing for MUltiple Repositories
Currently supporting mixed repos of git and svn

## For the impatient
- Set the environment variable ***SIMUR_REPO_CACHE*** to some directory, e.g.

> **set SIMUR_REPO_CACHE=\\\our-server\simur-share\simur_repo_cache**

if you do not set it, SIMuR will use the path **C:\simur_repo** by default

- Copy script\vcget.cmd to somewhere in your path, edit to get the right
python and correct path to script\vcget.py

**vcget.cmd is what your debugger will call to get the sources**

- Test for git by calling
> vcget.cmd git https://github.com/NilssonOpel/gitcat_test2.git success2.c 0e16bc26f432

You should get the content of sucess2.c, and you will have a clone of the
git repo in the folder given by SIMUR_REPO_CACHE (or C:\simur_repo if you did
not set it)

- Test for Subversion:
> vcget.cmd svn https://svn.riouxsvn.com/svncat_test1/trunk main.c 6

For Subversion SIMuR do not populate the SIMUR_REPO_CACHE, it will use 'svn cat'

- Test on you own sources
> processPDBs.py 'dir-with-pdbs' 'srcsrv-dir'

**Now the .pdb files should contain instructions how to fetch the correct source
files, which you can see by running**

> "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Debuggers\x64\srcsrv\pdbstr.exe" -r -p:TestGitCat.pdb -s:srcsrv

and it should look something like

    VERSION=1
    VERCTL=SvnGit

    SRCSRV: variables -----------------------------------------

Did it not work out?  Then try:

## To test it

If you have these installed
- Python 3.6 (ish)
- Visual Studio
- CMake
- Subversion
- Git
- Debugging Tools for Windows,
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/index

*There is an issue with Win10 that JIT debugging is by default disabled.  Since
the test program have a crash, this has to be enabled.  The crash is to get into
the debugger and to show that the debugger can pick up the remote sources*.

To enable JIT debugging please take a look at
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/debug-using-the-just-in-time-debugger?view=vs-2019

- Test it by going to the directory test/ and run ***TestExe.bat*** or
***TestWithLib.bat***

It should eventually break into your debugger if you have JIT Debugging enabled,
see above


## How it started

To get the source code from subversion is easy, just use **svn cat
url@revision**.  But when you work with git you must do something
else.  So my naive idea was to clone all the repositories into a local
directory (set by environment variable ***SIMUR_REPO_CACHE***) and use
**git show sha1** in the cloned repository.  It started as a git-thing but
then I realized you could mix it with other VCS:s so I added support for mixing
git ***and*** subversion.

Should not be that hard to add Mercurial I guess.

Will be interesting to see how it scales.

## What is source indexing?
It is a Microsoft thing, only available on Windows, there is a nice
introduction here:

https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2011/11/11/source-indexing-is-underused-awesomeness/

or google it, nice keywords: 'srcsrv', 'source indexing',
